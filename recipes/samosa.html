        <img class="samosa" src="../images/samosa.jpg" alt="Image of Samosas on Serving Dish">
        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Samosa is a potato-stuffed deep-fried snack very popular in India, the Middle East, and Asia. It originated from the Middle East and was brought to India by merchants. It is usually made with potatoes, spies, and herbs, although sometimes it is also made with minced meat (<em>keema</em>). Making samosa at home is very easy. This recipe will teach you how to make Punjabi samosa with potato stuffing. This recipe is adapted from Chef Harpal Singh's recipe.</p>

        <h2>Steps</2>
            <h3>For potatoes</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Boil potatoes until just done without becoming mushy. You can either boil them in a steamer, pot, or cooker.</li>
                    <li>Crumble potatoes, but do not mash them up. Set aside.</li>
                </ol>
            <h3>For samosa dough</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Mix together flour, carom seeds, salt, and oil in a mixing bowl.</li>
                    <li>Rub the flour well for 2 to 3 minutes in between palms to incorporate the oil or ghee well.</li>
                    <li>Take a handful of flour and press down with your fingers. It must hold its shape and not crumble.</li>
                    <li>Add small amounts of water at a time and mix with the flour to form a stiff dough. It should not be soft. Cover and rest for 25 to 30 minutes.</li>
                </ol>
            <h3>For potato stuffing</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Heat a pan with oil. Add cumin seeds.</li>
                    <li>When seeds begin to sizzle, add giner and fry until aromatic (about 30 to 60 seconds).</li>
                    <li>Add green peas and sauté for 2 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Add red chili powder, garam masala, cumin powder, chaat masala (optional), and fennel powder. Sauté for 30 seconds.</li>
                    <li>Add cooked potatoes and sprinkle salt. Mix and sauté for 2 to 3 minutes. Mix in coriander leaves and set aside to cool.</li>
                    <li>Taste and add more salt if needed. If using lemon juice, add it now.</li>
                </ol>
        <h3>For samosa</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Knead the dough gently to smoothen a bit. Make 5 portions and roll into balls. Cover the dough.</li>
                <li>Grease the rolling area and flatten the ball. Drizzle some oil.</li>
                <li>Begin to roll into an oval shape of 8.5 inches long by 6.5 inches wide. It should be neither too thick or too thin.</li>
                <li>Cut into two parts. The two parts make two samosa. If the edges are too thick, gently roll to thin down.</li>
                <li>Take one part and apply water over the straight edge (towards the cut aside). Join the edges to make a cone. Press down gently to seal the cone from the inside as well.</li>
                <li>Fill the cone with potato masala and press down with your finger to push it inside the cone. Smear water generously on both the other edges.</li>
                <li>Bring the edges together and seal them by pinching off the edges together. If you prefer to make a standing samosa make a pleat on one side. Bring back the pleat and seal it by pinching off the edges together.</li>
                <li>Make sure the samosa has been sealed well. Cover with a cloth to prevent from drying.</li>
                <li>After you have made 5 samosa, begin to heat the oil at medium heat.</li>
                <li>Make sure the oil is not too hot. To test, drop a piece of dough into the oil. It should not sizzle or rise immediately. Instead, you should see tiny bubbles in the oil and the dough should take a while to come to the surface.</li>
                <li>Gently add as many samosa as you can to the oil and fry on a low flame undisturbed for a few minutes (about 10 to 12 minutes).</li>
                <li>When the crust becomes firm, increase the flame to medium. Rotate samosa to the other side and fry until crispy and golden.</li>
                <li>While the first batch of samosa fry, make the rest of your samosa with remaining dough and filling.</li>
                <li>Remove the fried samosa onto a colander. Let the temperature of the oil come down slightly before you fry the next batch.</li>
                <li>Serve samosa with mint chutney, sweet tamarind chutney, or tomato sauce.</li>
                <li>Alternatively, you can bake the samosa in the oven. Preheat oven to 180 degrees Celsius or 360 degrees Fahrenheit for about 20 minutes. Brush each samosa generously with oil and place on baking tray. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes.</li>
