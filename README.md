Odin Recipes Project

This is my first time building a website. I am building a basic recipe website using HTML and CSS. Let's see how I go.

I have created four pages for this website. I have my index.html page and three recipe pages. I have filled in the basic boilerplate HTML on all pages.

In the index.html page, I have added a LeveL One heading and links to my three recipes pages using the unordered list element.

In each recipe page, I have added an image underneath the recipe name, a brief description of the recipe using the <p> element, a list of the ingredients as an unordered list, and the steps as an ordered list. I have used two to three levels of headings.

After adding the basic HTML to my pages, I started adding style elements to my pages using the external CSS method. I created my style.css file and added a link to it in the <head> section of all my pages. I then used the universal selector to change the default font on all pages to Verdana using the font-family property, and included backup fonts. I used type selectors to style my headings and paragraphs, and used the color, background-color, text-align, and font-size properties.

I used class selectors to resize my recipe images. I also created a class selector called "list" to style all my lists and then created an ID selector called "recipes" to style the unordered list on the homepage. I used the ID selector because I wanted to apply different style elements to the list on the homepage, and specificity rules would dictate the ID selector's rules would take precedence.

So far, I have found adding CSS to be a challenge, but I hope that with more practice it will become more intuitive.
